700B css-in-js solution.

# Motivation
I always wondered, if you can get a working solution for css-in-js with a smaller footprint. I started a project and wanted a to use styled-components. Looking at their sizes, it seems that I would rather not include ~16kB([styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)) or ~11kB([emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)) just so I can use the `styled` paradigm. So, I embarked in a mission to create a smaller alternative for these well established apis.

# Usage
The API is inspired by emotion, `styled` function. Meaning, you call it with your `tagName` and returns a vDOM component for that tag.

```jsx
import { styled } from "goober";

const Icon = styled("i")`
  display: flex;
  flex: 1;
  color: red;
`;

const Button = styled("button")`
  background: dodgerblue;
  color: white;
  border: 0;

  &:focus,
  &:hover {
    padding: 1em;
  }

  .otherClass {
    margin: 0;
  }

  ${Icon} {
    color: black;
  }
`;

```

# SSR
